# Choctopus44 Prototype - Build Guide

***WORK IN PROGRESS!***

The build process is quite straight forward for the most part as most parts can only really be soldered one way.

1. Solder diodes in the orientation indicated on the PCB. While they can be soldered on the top side of the PCB, in most cases it's preferrable to solder them to the bottom side
2. Solder hotswap sockets if those are used
3. Solder MCU socket and extra 1 pin battery sockets if used
4. Solder the reset button
5. Solder the power switch
6. Solder the switches, unless hotswap sockets are used
7. Solder the rotary encoder. If you are using an SMD encoder, you might find it useful to use flux to make it extra sure that solder doesn't flow into the wrong places (pictures TBA).
8. Solder battery leads if a battery is used (seen handwiring guide for proper function)
9. Socket or solder the controller
10. Assemble case, affix battery, add knob to encoder. Use 5mm stand offs for the main case with 3mm screws. Be mindful of not over tightening the screws as the switch plate flexes quite easily.
